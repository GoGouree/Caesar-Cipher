this is an encryption method used by Julias Caesar to write to his military in an encrypted and secure manner. 
the code relies on a key which is the number by which the alphabet gets shifted for encryption. since there are just 26 alphabets this is not the most secure method of encryption in todays age
read this on copilot and applied the python code to try it on my own - python coding has pages to explain this in detail
